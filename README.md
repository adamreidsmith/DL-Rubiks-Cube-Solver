# Solving Rubik’s Cubes with Deep Learning + Beam Search

---

## 📖 Overview
This project combines **deep learning** and **graph search** to solve the Rubik’s Cube. It extends and improves the methods developed in [this research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13266).
A neural network is trained to **predict the distance from any scrambled cube state to the solved state**, and this prediction is used as a **heuristic function** in a **beam search algorithm**.

Unlike traditional solvers with handcrafted heuristics, this approach learns the heuristic directly from data.
